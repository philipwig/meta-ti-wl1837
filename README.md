# meta-ti-wl1837
Yocto layer with required firmware and programs for wilink 8 drivers to support wl1837 module

You will also need to include wpa_supplicant, hostapd, and iw but these recipes are part of base yocto openembedded layers.
Also need wireless-regdb somehow, for Petalinux and zynq 7000 I used wireless-regdb-static
